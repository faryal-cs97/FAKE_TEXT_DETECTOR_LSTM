# FAKE_TEXT_DETECTOR_LSTM
Overview
The Fake Text Detector is a machine learning project designed to identify and classify fake text content using advanced techniques such as sentiment analysis and syntactic analysis. This project leverages TensorFlow, Keras, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to effectively analyze and predict the authenticity of text data.

Detects fake text content with high accuracy.

Utilizes advanced LSTM architecture for text classification.

Implements data cleaning techniques for preprocessing.

Conducts sentiment analysis to understand the emotional tone.

Performs syntactic analysis to examine sentence structure.

Technologies Used

TensorFlow: For building and training the neural network model.

Keras: High-level API for creating and training the LSTM model.

Pickle: For model serialization and persistence.

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, and others for data manipulation and analysis.

Data Preparation: Ensure your text data is in the required format.

Data Cleaning: The data cleaning script will preprocess the raw text data for analysis.

Data Cleaning
The data cleaning module removes noise from the text, including special characters, stop words, and performs tokenization. This is crucial for improving model accuracy.

Model Training
The LSTM model is trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake texts. It utilizes sequences of words to understand context and semantics, enhancing its predictive capabilities.

Sentiment and Syntactic Analysis
Sentiment analysis is employed to gauge the emotional tone of the text, while syntactic analysis helps in understanding the grammatical structure. Both analyses contribute to more accurate predictions.

Model Persistence
The trained model is serialized using Pickle, allowing for easy loading and predictions in future applications without retraining.
